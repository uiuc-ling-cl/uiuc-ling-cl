	As a quick reference for use of git, this book covers most of hands-on commands for common operations on Git.

#### Required tools and software

* Students are expected to have their own computers for after-class exercises and assignments.

* Programming language used in this course is **Python** of version 3. 

	Students are responsible for installing the programming environment on their own computers. It is recommended to install Python and relevant modules via [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
	
*  Git software and [Github](https://github.com) account for assignment deployment and submission 
	
	Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) that records changes to a file or set of files over time. For Mac users, as the git software is built in the macOS nothing needs to be done. For Windows users, the binary installer can be downloaded from [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for installation. While both 32- and 64-bit versions are available for downloading, Windows systems of contemporary versions should fully support the latter. 
	
	Students are required to register a free Github account at [https://github.com](https://github.com), where exercises and assignments will be submitted to for grading during the course.

<!-- 
#### Learning Goals and Outcomes

Students are expected to attend class and lab session, regularly practice the presented tools and techniques, and complete all assigned work.

Students who do so are expected to attain the learning goals and outcomes.
 -->



## Grading

Students will be assessed on the extent to which they have attained the learning goals & outcomes. This assessment will be primarily hands-on, assessed through a combination practical exercises in computer lab and homework assignments. Assessments on theories in a written form however will make up a relatively small portion of the final grade.

Grades will be assessed on a 100-point scale:

* Lecture attendance, lab exercises and theory assessments will make up 50% of the overall grade:
	* Attendance: **10%**
	* Mid-term assessment: **10%**
	* End-term assessment: **10%**
	* Lab exercise: **30%**

* After-class programming and scripting assignments will make up **40%** of the overall grade


 The final letter grade for this course will be converted from the numeric grade using the following table:

| Numerical grade		|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Letter grade 	|
| :----:       			|:----:|    :----   	|
| 98.00 - 100.00      	|      | A+       		|
| 92.00 - 97.99      	|      | A       		|
| 90.00 - 91.99     	|      | A-       		|
| 88.00 - 89.99   		|      | B+       		|
| 82.00 - 87.99      	|      | B       		|
| 80.00 - 81.99      	|      | B-       		|
| 78.00 - 79.99      	|      | C+       		|
| 72.00 - 77.99      	|      | C       		|
| 70.00 - 71.99      	|      | C-       		|
| 68.00 - 69.99      	|      | D+       		|
| 62.00 - 67.99      	|      | D       		|
| 60.00 - 61.99     	|      | D-       		|
| < 60.00		     	|      | F       		|


## DRES

If a student has a disability or condition that requires special consideration, the student is expected to email the instructor and the TA no later than the beginning of the third week. The message should:

* Include a scanned attachment of the requisite letter from the University Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services.
* Include a detailed description of the accommodations that the student is actually requesting for this class.



## Academic Integrity

This course follows the [University of Illinois Student Code regarding Academic Integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/). The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences also has [an excellent web page on the topic](http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity). You are expected to read these resources prior to the second day of class, and to understand your responsibilities with regard to Academic Integrity. 

All work submitted for this class must be solely each student's own. 
Violations of Academic Integrity include, but are not limited to, copying, cheating, and unapproved collaboration. 
There is zero-tolerance to any form of violations.



## Absences and Late Work Policy

#### Excused absence

If a student will be absent from class for any reason, the student is expected to inform the course instructor ahead of time should the student wish to receive penalty-free credit:

* Each absence must be separately reported ahead of time via a private post on Campuswise to the instructor
* Each Campuswise post must be filed under the folder "excused-absence"
* Each Campuswise post must list the date of the absence
* Each Campuswise post must list the reason for the absence
* Each Campuswise post must mention whether or not makeup credit is being requested

No penalty-free credit will be granted if the procedure is not strictly followed. However, **penalty-free credits from excused absence can be no more than 30% of the total Attendance credits presented above**. Once penalty-free credits reach the limit, no more credit will be granted for any form of absence.

#### Late work

In-class exercises during a lab session must be turned in before 23:59:59 the day the lab session takes place. Any late submission will result in zeros point from that lab session.

Homework assignments are expected to be turned in on time. Homework turned in late will be docked 10 percentage points per day late.

For some or all homework assignments, the correct solution will be presented to the class after the homework deadline. The solution will typically be presented during the class on Wednesday after the assignment is due. Under no circumstances will late work be accepted after the solution has been presented to the class.


#### Penalty-free late days

However, it is understood that illness and other extraordinary events do occur from time to time. In order to accommodate such extraordinary events, students will be allotted a budget of three (3) penalty-free late days for which no late penalty will be assessed for lab session tasks and homework assignments. **Penalty-free late days are intended to accommodate unforeseeable extraordinary events, not poor planning or poor time management.**

If a student wishes to make use of a penalty-free late day, the student must do **all** of the following **prior to the current assignment deadline**:

* Post a private Campuswise message to the instructor:
  * The message **must** be filed under the Campuswise category for that homework assignment.
  * The title of the message **must** be "Penalty-free late day (X of 5)", where X is replaced by the number 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
  * In the body of the message, the student must explicitly request the use of a penalty-free late day.
* In the student's git repository for the assignment, the student must note the request in the appropriate file, check in the change, and push the change to the appropriate remote repository.

Only when all of these steps have been taken prior to the deadline will a penalty-free late day be applied. If a student wishes to make use of more than one penalty-free late day per assignment, all of the above steps must be performed separately for each penalty-free late day.

Penalty-free late days cannot be used to extend any deadline beyond the last regular day of class for the semester.

Penalty-free late days cannot be used to turn in work after the solution has been presented to the students.

Penalty-free late days do not apply to mid- and end-term assessment.
