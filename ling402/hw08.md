## Due at 23:59:59 Sunday, October 18 2020

Implement scripts to parse document using O-O programming

1. Implement a python class call "Doc" in part1_doc.py (35%). Methods to be implemented include:
* The initialiser, i.e. __init__()
* tostring()

2. Implement a python class call "Parser" in part2_parser.py (50%). Methods to be implemented include:
* The initialiser, i.e. __init__()
* searchCites()
* searchAcronyms()
* buildWordlist()
* mkDict()
* countChars()

3. Implement a python script to parse a given text file "History_ASR.txt" supplied in the same directory (15%)


The templates are provided along with instructions and requirements for each block in the files. Add your code to where Python keyword -- **pass** -- shows in the templates.

Please read carefully while implementing the code, or you may lose points if requirements are not met despite the results being correct.
