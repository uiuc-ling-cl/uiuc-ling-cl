# LING402: lab14
## Due at 23:59:59 Friday, Dec 04 2020


* Follow the instructions at the beginning of "lab14.py" to convert the output in IOB strings from lab13 (provided here as "IOB_tags.txt") back to chunked sentences in tree format. 

* The generated trees must be saved in "ChunkedTree_IOB.txt"

* "ChunkedTree_IOB.txt" should be identical to "ChunkedTree.txt" in lab13 if you implement the parser correctly
	
* You code should include essential documentations to help others understand what your code does

* You must submit "lab14.py" and "ChunkedTree_IOB.txt" under the "LAB14" diretory in the repository of hw12
