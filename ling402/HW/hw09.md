# LING402: hw09
## Due at 23:59:59 Sunday, October 25 2020


Implement scripts to train a probabilistic context-free grammar.


1. Implement part1.py (30%)
  * The input to this script accepts parenthesized trees from the Wall Street Journal treebank in the mrg format - **"input.part1.mrg"** -- in which the format is in disarray
  * The output from this script, **"output.part1"**, will be trees in the same parenthesized format, but one tree per line
  * **"output.part1"** will be trees with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and with the extra set of parentheses removed
  
2. Implement part2.py (35%)
  * The input to this script is the output of part1.py - "output.part1"
  * The output from this script, **"output.part2"**, will be rules
  * Unary rules will be in the following format: *child\<TAB\>parent*
  * Binary rules will be in the following format: *child1\<SPACE\>child2\<TAB\>parent*
  * Rules with more than 2 children will be in similar format, with children (separated by spaces), then a tab, then the parent

3. Implement part3.sh (15%)
  * The input to this script is the output of part2.py - "output.part2"
  * In the output of this script, **"output.part3"**, lines will be in the following format: *count\<TAB\>children\<TAB\>parent*
  * See the instructions at the beginning of the template of part3.sh for details
  
4. Implement part4.py (20%)
  * The input to this script is the output of part3.sh - "output.part3"
  * In the output of this script, **"output.part4"**, lines will be in the following format: *probability\<TAB\>children\<TAB\>parent*
  * "output.part4" will be sorted by the probability of each entry from high to low
  * See the instructions in the template of part4.py for details

Note that, despite the expected output files being provided, your scripts should not only be produced for the sake of matching the expected outputs. You scripts may be tested on different files for grading.



Use of git is required
----------------------

You are required to use git for this assignment.

To check out the homework assignment:

* ssh YOUR_NETID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu
* clone the repository for this homework from GitHub

Your workflow should be as follows:

First, edit one of the scripts, using the text editor of your choice.

Next, commit your changes using git:

* git add part*
* git commit -m "A BRIEF MESSAGE EXPLAINING WHAT YOU CHANGED"
* git push

You should follow the above steps after every edit of the file. 


Testing your scripts
--------------------

It is your responsibility to test each script to verify that it functions correctly.
