# LING402: hw01
## Due at 23:59:59 Saturday, August 29 2020

### **Part 1**


* Connect to the cl server using ssh
* On the cl server, use git clone to clone this repository
* In the current directory (as where this "README.md" is located), create a file called hello.sh
* Use vi (or emacs) to edit hello.sh.
* The first line of your hello.sh file must be a shebang line that indicates the script should be run using bash.
* When executed, your script should print the message "Hello, world" to standard output
* On line 2 of your script, you must include a one line comment explaining how your script causes "Hello, world" to be printed. This message must be no shorter than 7 words. If the comment is not on line 2, or if your comment is less than 7 words long, you will not receive credit for this part.
* Use chmod to make the file executable
* Run the script to verify that it works
* Use git add to add hello.sh
* Use git commit. Use a meaningful commit message.
* Run the rubric.sh script to verify that you have completed all parts of the assignment
* Use git add to add grade.tsv
* Use git push to turn in this assignment



### **Part 2**

During this semester, you will be required to gain proficiency with at least one command line text editor. The two most widely used command line text editors are [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). There are others (such as [nano](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/), but in this class you will be expected to become proficient with at least one of Emacs or Vim.

In this assignment you will play the first levels of [an online VIM tutorial game](http://vim-adventures.com). The game is designed to teach you proficiency in the most important keyboard shortcuts needed to efficiently use Vim. There is a paid version that costs $25, and provides more in-depth tutorial lessons. In this assignment you only need to play the free levels.

In this part you will also practice more use of the Linux command line, and will upload a file to the class server.


Do the following:

* Go to [VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com)
* Play the game through the end of the free levels
* When you get to the end of the free levels, it should look something like this (images in "assets" directory in the homework repository):

![this](assets/img/vim1.png)


* At the bottom of the screen, select "User Statistics Screen": 

![this](assets/img/vim2.png)


* You should now see the "User Statistics Screen": 

![this](assets/img/vim3.png)

* Take a screenshot of your entire screen, including the "User Statistics Screen". Save the screenshot as hw01b.jpg. If your screenshot program saved the file as something other than a JPEG, open it with an image editor and save it as a JPEG, with the exact file name hw01b.jpg
* Open a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator). On Mac OS X, this will be a program called [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)) in your Applications/Utilities folder. On Windows, you will likely need to download and set up a third-party program such as [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). On Linux, this will be the [GNOME Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal) or [KDE Konsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole), or [the equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators).

* At the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) within the terminal emulator, use [scp](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/scp1.html) to upload hw01b.jpg to the cl.linguistics.illinois.edu server:

```bash
scp hw01b.jpg yourActualNetID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu:~/hw01b.jpg
```

If you're using Windows, instead of doing the above, you'll probably need to use a different third-party SCP client for Windows such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to upload the file.


* At the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) within the terminal emulator, connect to the cl.linguistics.illinois.edu server using [ssh](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ssh1.html). Your username is your NetID, and your password should be your [NetID password](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/netid-password). Note: to connect to the server from off campus, you may first need to connect to the campus network using an approved [VPN client](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn/download-and-set-up-the-vpn-client).

```bash
ssh yourActualNetID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu
```

* Use [ls](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls.html) to verify that you successfully uploaded the file:

```bash
ls -l ~/
```

You should see a file listed called hw01b.jpg, with a date and timestamp that corresponds to when you uploaded the files. If you don't, that probably means you did not successfully upload hw01b.jpg. You should also see a directory whose name starts with "hw01". This is where you cloned the repository of this assignment.


* Use [mkdir](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mkdir.html) to create a directory called "assignment" at the root of the repository:

```bash
mkdir ~/hw01b-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/assignment
```

* Use [mv](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mv.html) to move hw01b.jpg into the newly created directory:

```bash
mv ~/hw01b.jpg ~/hw01b-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/assignment
```

* Use [ls](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls.html) to verify that you successfully moved the file:

```bash
ls -l ~/hw01b-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/assignment
```

You should see a file listed called hw01b.jpg, with a date and timestamp. If you don't, that probably means you did not successfully move hw01b.jpg into the target directory.

Use cd to navigate into the hw01b directory

```bash
cd ~/hw01b-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

* Use git add to add hw01b.jpg
* Use git commit. Use a meaningful commit message.
* Use git push to turn in the assignment
