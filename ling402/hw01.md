# LING402: hw01
## Due at 23:59:59 Saturday, August 29 2020


During this semester, you will be required to gain proficiency with at least one command line text editor. The two most widely used command line text editors are [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). There are others (such as [nano](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/), but in this class you will be expected to become proficient with at least one of Emacs or Vim.

In this assignment you will play the first levels of [an online VIM tutorial game](http://vim-adventures.com). The game is designed to teach you proficiency in the most important keyboard shortcuts needed to efficiently use Vim. There is a paid version that costs $25, and provides more in-depth tutorial lessons. In this assignment you only need to play the free levels.

In this part you will also practice more use of the Linux command line, and will upload a file to the class server.


Do the following:

* Go to [VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com)
* Play the game through the end of the free levels
* When you get to the end of the free levels, it should look something like this (images in "assets" directory in the homework repository):

* At the bottom of the screen, select "User Statistics Screen":

* You should now see the "User Statistics Screen": 

![this](assets/img/vim3.png)

* Take a screenshot of your entire screen, including the "User Statistics Screen". Save the screenshot as hw01.jpg. If your screenshot program saved the file as something other than a JPEG, open it with an image editor and save it as a JPEG, with the exact file name hw01.jpg
* Open a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator). On Mac OS X, this will be a program called [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)) in your Applications/Utilities folder. On Windows, you will likely need to download and set up a third-party program such as [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). On Linux, this will be the [GNOME Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal) or [KDE Konsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole), or [the equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators).

* At the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) within the terminal emulator, use [scp](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/scp1.html) to upload hw01.jpg to the cl.linguistics.illinois.edu server:

```bash
scp hw01.jpg yourActualNetID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu:~/hw01.jpg
```

If you're using Windows, instead of doing the above, you'll probably need to use a different third-party SCP client for Windows such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to upload the file.


* At the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) within the terminal emulator, connect to the cl.linguistics.illinois.edu server using [ssh](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ssh1.html). Your username is your NetID, and your password should be your [NetID password](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/netid-password). Note: to connect to the server from off campus, you may first need to connect to the campus network using an approved [VPN client](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn/download-and-set-up-the-vpn-client).

```bash
ssh yourActualNetID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu
```

* Use [ls](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls.html) to verify that you successfully uploaded the file:

```bash
ls -l ~/
```

You should see a file listed called hw01.jpg, with a date and timestamp that corresponds to when you uploaded the files. If you don't, that probably means you did not successfully upload hw01.jpg. You should also see a directory whose name contains "hw01". This is where you cloned the repository of this assignment.


* Use [mkdir](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mkdir.html) to create a directory called "upload" at the root of the repository:

```bash
mkdir ~/ling402-2020f-hw01-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/upload
```

* Use [mv](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mv.html) to move hw01.jpg into the newly created directory:

```bash
mv ~/hw01.jpg ~/ling402-2020f-hw01-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/upload
```

* Use [ls](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls.html) to verify that you successfully moved the file:

```bash
ls -l ~/ling402-2020f-hw01-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/upload
```

You should see a file listed called hw01.jpg, with a date and timestamp. If you don't, that probably means you did not successfully move hw01.jpg into the target directory.

Use "cd" to navigate into the hw01 directory

```bash
cd ~/ling402-2020f-hw01-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

* Use "git add" to add "hw01.jpg"
* Use "git commit" to commit the changes with a meaningful message.
* Use git push to turn in the assignment
