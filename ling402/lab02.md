# LING402: lab02
## Due at 23:59:59 Friday, September 04 2020

Use shell commands and pipe operators to identify the _longest_ Finnish word in the file "ep-00-01.17.fi", and print the length of the word, i.e. the number of characters, to the STDOUT.

* Save your command to a file called "longest.sh"

* Make the file executable when invoking "./longest.sh"

* HINT: if you do not know where to start, you should watch this week's videos - "Demos: determine the most frequent word and word lengths" - for ideas

* "longest.sh" must be placed under the "LAB" diretory in the repository of hw02

* Use the git commands to turn "longest.sh" in before the deadline
